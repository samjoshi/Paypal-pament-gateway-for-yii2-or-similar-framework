This is very simple papal payment gateway.
Advantage of that we need only an email id where you want pay.

File structure according to YII2 or similar framework.

1) In the component we need only put the same file where you can set pay url like (demo or live) and curl setting is there .
2) In the controller we can call a model there where you insert data in data base like(user_is, payment method,amount,date etc..) and after that render view page. 
3) In the view page we can set paypal email id where you want to pay,quantity, amout, name of reason of payment,return url,cancel return url,notify url,and you can set id there which id you want update in database table.
